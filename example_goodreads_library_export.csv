This was written by a Cambridge reject and it shows.<br/><br/>Apparently there are 3 paths in life: go to Cambridge or an equivalent wannabe Oxbridge and see unbelievable success, start a YouTube channel based on unresolved trauma (I wont even go into how useless the parents in this book are) or work in a theatre. The constant attempts to push the importance of apprenticeships whilst simultaneously managing to present them as an option for the academically lacking completely destroys the foolish intent to lecture readers on the age old ""dont judge a book by its cover"" bullshit.<br/><br/>Frances' entire personality is based on academic success and we are supposed to believe she would throw it all away for art college and a credit on a YouTube channel. Unimagnitative crap. Clearly Oxbridge is the only option and failure of acceptance should result in changing paths completely - take a gap year love!<br/><br/>Aled, Daniel, Carys and the plethora of useless background characters are poorly written and ill-considered. Again, this comes down to the lack of any personality and a need for constant unresolvable conflict. As previously complained upon, the characters fall into two categories: A grade students, awaiting placement at prestigious universities, or stereotypically dumb (unsurprisingly female) students.<br/><br/>I genuinely cannot finish this review, the whole book angered me a ridiculous amount. Unbelievably naive for an author privileged enough to have benefited from a university experience to try and lecture readers on alternatives.<br/><br/>For all of my loyal followers: I have privated my reviews to make sure the Oseman fans dont come for me ",,,1,0
